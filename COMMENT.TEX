Creating our User Class

Testing our find_all method
  - admin Area
    <?php
       $sql = "SELECT * FROM  users WHERE id= 1";
       $result = $database->query($sql);
       $user_found = mysqli_fetch_array($result);
       echo $user_found['last_name'];
    ?>

    <?php
       $user = new User();
       $result_set = $user->find_all_users();

       while($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result_set)){
           echo $row['username'] . "<br>";
       }
    ?>
- This code is not much better  bse we have to instantiate   the objet .The better way
  is to use static

Static Method Usage and Challenge

   $result_set = User::find_all_users();

     while($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result_set)){
         echo $row['username'] . "<br>";
     }

Creating a Find user id method and Solution
      $found_user = User::find_user_by_id(2);
      echo $found_user['username'];

Create This Query Method
 public  static  function  find_this_query($sql)
    {
        global $database;
        $result_set = $database->query($sql);
        return $result_set ;
    }

Assigning Array Values to Object Properties
 - to return an object like $user->username ; instead of an array found_user['password'];
        <?php
            $found_user = User::find_user_by_id(3);

             $user = new User();
             $user->id           = $found_user['id'];
             $user->username     = $found_user['username'];
             $user->password     = $found_user['password'];
             $user->first_name   = $found_user['first_name'];
             $user->last_name    = $found_user['last_name'];
             echo $user->id;

Auto Instantiation Method
 - we need to make the above code better
 -create a method in user class
    private  static function instantantion($found_user)
        {
            $the_object = new self;
            $the_object->id           = $found_user['id'];
            $the_object->username     = $found_user['username'];
            $the_object->password     = $found_user['password'];
            $the_object->first_name   = $found_user['first_name'];
            $the_object->last_name    = $found_user['last_name'];

            return $the_object;
        }
NB:what if we have 100 fields in database ? we shoudl use the loop

Testing the Instantiation Method

 <?php
    $found_user = User::find_user_by_id(3);

    $user = User::instantantion($found_user );
    echo $user->last_name;

?>

 Short Way Auto Instantiation
 -The short way using the array  if you have many attributes
 -we are getting the associative arrays
  public  static function instantantion($the_record)
      {
          $the_object = new self;

          foreach ($the_record as  $the_attaribute => $value) {
              if ($the_object->has_the_attribute($the_attaribute)){
                  $the_object->the_attribute = $value;
              }
          }
          return $the_object;
      }


 Creating The Attribute Finder Method
   private  function  has_the_attribute($the_attribute)
       {
          $object_properties = get_object_vars($this);
          //if the key exist
          return  array_key_exists($the_attribute, $object_properties);
       }

Adding our Instantiation Method
-we gonna make the use of the Instantiation method in user class
- To get the use object instead of while loop
-Modified the query method in user class find_this_query($sql)

Using our Instantiation Method to find all users
-Display the information without using while loop  find_all_users()
     <?php
         $users = User::find_all_users();
         foreach ($users as $user){
             echo $user->username . "<br>";
         }
    ?>

8. Using our Instantiation Method to find 1 User
  -find user by id
  -modified the find_user_by_id($user_id) functionality
      public static  function find_user_by_id($user_id)
          {
              global $database;
             // $result_set = $database->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $user_id LIMIT 1");

              $the_result_array =  self::find_this_query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $user_id LIMIT 1");

              return !empty($the_result_array) ? array_shift($the_result_array) : false;

              or
             /* //$found_user = mysqli_fetch_array($result_set);
              if (!empty($the_result_array)){
                $first_item =  array_shift($the_result_array);
                return  $first_item;
              }else{
                  return false;
              }
              return $found_user;*/


          }

- test find user
   <?php
      $found_user = User::find_user_by_id(3);
      echo $found_user->username;

   ?>

 Undeclared Object Backup Function
 -use autoload
 -we need a function which will help us instead we forgot to add something .
 -SAFETENES
 -will used as scannning our application
 -we need to include in init file

Updating the Autoload Function (Edwin from the future
-update the above autoload with spl_autolaod()

SUMMARY - USER CLASS
What each method is doing ....Let's  use the User class for example

 User::find_all()  ... Here is the flow once is called

1.   It goes to the find_all method

2. The find_all() returns the find_by_query() results

3. The find_by_query()  does a couple things

       1. it makes the query

        2. Fetches the the data from database table using  a while loop and it returns it in $row

        3. Passes the results ($row) to the Instantiation (instantantion - weird name I know) method

        4. Returns the object in the $the_object_array variable that it gets from the  instantantion method.

        5. And that will be the result that find_all() returns when we use User::find_all()



  What the Instantation method is doing

   1. Gets the calling class name.

   2. Creates an instance of the class

   3. It loops through the $the_record variable that has all the records

   4. It checks to see if the properties exist on that object with the other method has_the_property()

   5. If the keys from the record which basically are the columns from db table are found or equal the object properties then it assigns    the values to them.

  6. Finally it returns the object!



The purpose of this is to basically create our own API to deal with the database query so that in the future we can plug in other API's. Now there still a couple things I want to improve to make this way better, cleaner and more universal.
